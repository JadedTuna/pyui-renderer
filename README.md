# pyui-renderer

This script will convert `.pyui` file into HTML file which then can be viewed in the browser.

Please note, it is experimental! For now it supports only `View`, `Label` and `TextField` elements (hopefully). If you have any ideas how to improve it - feel free to fork and then make a pull request!
